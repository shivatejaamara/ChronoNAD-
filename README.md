# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the ChronoNAD+ landing page project.
  This little project is a mockup website for a fictional health supplement called ChronoNAD+ from CellStart. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate landing page that showcases the product's   benefits and the science behind it.
## The site is built with three simple files:
 index.html: This is the skeleton of the page, where all the content lives.
 style.css: This file is the stylist! It handles all the colors, fonts, and layouts to make the page look good.
 script.js: A bit of magic that makes the page interactive, like the smooth scrolling and the little "Added to cart!" message that pops up.
## What Makes This Page Special? âœ¨
  It's Flexible: The design is fully responsive, meaning it looks great whether you're viewing it on a big desktop screen or on your phone.
 Smooth Sailing: Clicking any of the navigation links or "Shop Now" buttons will smoothly glide you to the right section of the pageâ€”no jumpy transitions!
 Organized and Tidy: The CSS is written in a component-based way, so everything from the header to the benefit cards is easy to find and modify. It's built with Flexbox and CSS Grid for a solid, modern layout.
 Mock-up Magic: Ever wonder what happens when you click "Shop Now" on a site? This page has a little mock functionality that gives you a glimpse of the experience by displaying a quick "toast" notification.
## Ready to See It in Action? ðŸš€
 It's super easy to get this up and running. Just follow these two steps:
