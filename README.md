Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the ChronoNAD+ landing page project.

This little project is a mockup website for a fictional health supplement called ChronoNAD+ from CellStart. The goal was to create a clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate landing page that showcases the product's benefits and the science behind it.

<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 1px;">THE SITE IS BUILT WITH THREE SIMPLE FILES:</p>

index.html: This is the skeleton of the page, where all the content lives.

style.css: This file is the stylist! It handles all the colors, fonts, and layouts to make the page look good.

script.js: A bit of magic that makes the page interactive, like the smooth scrolling and the little "Added to cart!" message that pops up.

<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 1px;">WHAT MAKES THIS PAGE SPECIAL? âœ¨</p>

It's Flexible: The design is fully responsive, meaning it looks great whether you're viewing it on a big desktop screen or on your phone.

Smooth Sailing: Clicking any of the navigation links or "Shop Now" buttons will smoothly glide you to the right section of the pageâ€”no jumpy transitions!

Organized and Tidy: The CSS is written in a component-based way, so everything from the header to the benefit cards is easy to find and modify. It's built with Flexbox and CSS Grid for a solid, modern layout.

Mock-up Magic: Ever wonder what happens when you click "Shop Now" on a site? This page has a little mock functionality that gives you a glimpse of the experience by displaying a quick "toast" notification.

<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 1px;">READY TO SEE IT IN ACTION? ðŸš€</p>
